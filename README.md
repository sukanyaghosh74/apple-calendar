## ‚ö†Ô∏è Caveats & Troubleshooting

While the event fetching system is fully implemented using Apple's official CalDAV protocol and the tsdav library, there are a few things to be aware of:

- **App-Specific Passwords:** Always use a fresh app-specific password generated from [appleid.apple.com](https://appleid.apple.com/account/manage). Expired or previously used passwords may not work.
- **iCloud Account Requirements:** Your iCloud account must have at least one calendar and some events in the next 7 days for results to appear.
- **2FA Required:** Two-factor authentication must be enabled on your Apple ID to generate app-specific passwords.
- **Network/Firewall Issues:** Some networks or firewalls may block CalDAV requests. If you encounter connection errors, try a different network.
- **Apple CalDAV Quirks:** Apple's CalDAV server can sometimes rate-limit or temporarily block requests, especially after multiple failed logins.
- **Event Parsing:** Rare or complex event formats (e.g., certain recurring events) may not display perfectly.
- **Region/Account Variations:** Some iCloud accounts (especially with non-standard regions or settings) may behave differently.

**If you encounter any issues:**
- Double-check your credentials and password freshness.
- Make sure you have events in your iCloud calendar for the next 7 days.
- Check backend logs for error messages.
